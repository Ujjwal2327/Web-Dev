5 startup wale ke paas jyada knowledge hoti hai as compared to 5 mnc wale
big mnc me log km kaam krte hain as compared to startup

approach janii hai q solve krne ki

notes are not means for codes

js engine

console.log()
seperation of concern
variable
let
    global scope
var
    local scope to nearest code blocks {}
    redeclaration not possible
const
    assignment is not defined
variable naming conventions
    int a,b;
    // best practice
        int a;
        int b;

datatypes
    primitive
        string
        number
            int, float, double, etc
        boolean
        Undefined (gv in C++)
        Null (empty / no value)

dynamic typing
    datatype of a can be change

reference types
    Objects
        multiple variables are linked, so wrap them as properties in one entity 
    arrays
        can also contain diff types of items too
    functions

operators
    arithmetic
        + - * / **(exponentiation / power)
    
    pre / post increament / decreament      ++a a++ --a a--
    
    assignment  =
    
    comparision
        > < >= <=
        equality operator
            ===
                strict equality
                same datatype and value
            ==
                loose equality
                can be same value only
        !==
    
    ternary operator
    
    logical operator
        && || !
    logical operator with non boolean values
        falsy
            undefined Null 0 false NaN(Not a Number) ' '
        anything other than falsy
    short circuiting in or operator
        if any is true, no need to check further    ans will be true
    short circuiting in and operator
        if any is false, no need to check further   ans will be false
    
    bitwise operator
        &   |   ~   ^

    operator precedence
        best practice   use brackets properly
    
control statements
    if-elseif-else
    switch case

loops
    for loop
    while loop
    do-while loop
        atleast execute once
    what is an infinite loop
    for-in loop
    for-of loop
